# Lesson 18: Capstone Project

In this final lesson, we will guide you through the process of planning, designing, and implementing a full-stack application using GraphQL and TypeScript. This capstone project will allow you to apply everything you have learned throughout the course, from foundational concepts to advanced features and best practices. We will cover the planning phase, implementing core features, integrating advanced GraphQL concepts and external services, deploying the application, and preparing for production. Finally, we will discuss how to present your project and the challenges you may face along the way. 

## Planning and Designing a Full-Stack Application Using GraphQL and TypeScript

### 1. Defining the Project Scope

Before starting the implementation, it’s essential to define the scope of your project. Consider the following aspects:

- **Application Type**: Decide whether you want to build a blog, e-commerce site, social media platform, or another type of application.
- **Core Features**: List the core features you want to implement. For example, if you are building a blog, you might include:
  - User authentication (sign up, login, logout)
  - CRUD operations for posts (create, read, update, delete)
  - Comments and likes functionality
  - Search and filtering capabilities

### 2. Designing the GraphQL Schema

Once you have defined the project scope, design your GraphQL schema. This includes defining types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

**Example: GraphQL Schema for a Blog Application**
```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  email: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  author: User!
  comments: [Comment!]!
}

type Comment {
  id: ID!
  text: String!
  author: User!
  post: Post!
}

type Query {
  users: [User!]!
  posts: [Post!]!
  post(id: ID!): Post
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(username: String!, email: String!, password: String!): User!
  createPost(title: String!, content: String!): Post!
  createComment(postId: ID!, text: String!): Comment!
}
```

### 3. Planning the Frontend

Decide on the frontend framework you will use (e.g., React, Next.js) and plan the components you will need. Consider the following:

- **Component Structure**: Break down your application into reusable components (e.g., PostList, PostDetail, CommentForm).
- **State Management**: Decide how you will manage state (e.g., using Apollo Client for GraphQL data, React Context for global state).

## Implementing Core Features with a Focus on Best Practices

### 1. Setting Up the Development Environment

Set up your development environment with the necessary tools and libraries. This includes:

- **Backend**: Apollo Server, TypeScript, and any database you choose (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
- **Frontend**: Next.js, Apollo Client, and any other libraries you need (e.g., React Router, styled-components).

### 2. Implementing Authentication

Implement user authentication using JWT or another method. Ensure that you validate user inputs and secure your API endpoints.

**Example: User Registration and Authentication**
```typescript
// Mutation for user registration
const resolvers = {
  Mutation: {
    createUser: async (_, { username, email, password }) => {
      // Validate inputs and hash password
      // Save user to database
    },
  },
};
```

### 3. Implementing CRUD Operations

Implement the core features of your application, focusing on best practices such as input validation, error handling, and using efficient queries.

**Example: Creating a Post**
```typescript
const resolvers = {
  Mutation: {
    createPost: async (_, { title, content }, { user }) => {
      if (!user) throw new Error('Unauthorized');
      // Save post to database
    },
  },
};
```

### 4. Integrating Advanced GraphQL Concepts

Incorporate advanced GraphQL concepts such as subscriptions for real-time updates (e.g., new comments) and batching requests to optimize performance.

**Example: Implementing Subscriptions**
```typescript
const resolvers = {
  Subscription: {
    newComment: {
      subscribe: () => pubsub.asyncIterator(['NEW_COMMENT']),
    },
  },
};
```

## Integrating Advanced GraphQL Concepts and External Services

### 1. Using External APIs

Integrate external services such as headless CMS (e.g., Contentful) or payment gateways (e.g., Stripe) to enhance your application’s functionality.

### 2. Implementing Serverless Functions

Consider using serverless functions for specific features, such as handling payments or processing webhooks.

## Deploying the Application and Preparing for Production

### 1. Preparing for Deployment

Before deploying your application, ensure that you have:

- Optimized your code for performance (e.g., minimizing bundle size, optimizing queries).
- Implemented security best practices (e.g., validating inputs, securing secrets).

### 2. Deploying to Cloud Platforms

Choose a cloud platform for deployment. Common options include:

- **Vercel**: Ideal for Next.js applications.
- **AWS**: For serverless architecture using Lambda.
- **Heroku**: For traditional server deployments.

**Example: Deploying to Vercel**
1. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Deploy your application:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

### 3. Managing Environment Variables

Use environment variables to manage sensitive information such as API keys and database connection strings.

**Example: Using `.env` Files**
```plaintext
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey
```

## Presenting the Project and Discussing Challenges Faced

### 1. Preparing Your Presentation

When presenting your project, consider the following structure:

- **Introduction**: Briefly explain the purpose of your application and its key features.
- **Demo**: Showcase the functionality of your application, highlighting the core features and user experience.
- **Technical Overview**: Discuss the architecture of your application, including the GraphQL schema, resolvers, and any external services used.
- **Challenges and Solutions**: Share any challenges you faced during development and how you overcame them. This could include technical hurdles, design decisions, or time management issues.

### 2. Gathering Feedback

Encourage feedback from peers or mentors during your presentation. This can provide valuable insights and suggestions for future improvements.
